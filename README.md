mini project Algorithmic: Hangman Game with Binary Tree of Research

Project Objective:
The goal of this small project is to program the hangmanâ€™s game using a search tree
binary. In order to allow a quick search of words in the dictionary, offer a
efficiency to determine if a word is included in the dictionary and to facilitate the addition of
new words.

Features:
Creating a dictionary of words in a tree form: The different words
of the game will be stored in a text file and then represented as a tree
search binary, as described below.
Manage the word dictionary: Have the ability to add, delete and
search for words.
Hangman Game: The binary search tree is used to represent words in
guess. In each round, the player offers a letter. Depending on the letter
proposed, the program runs through the tree to check if the letter is present in the
word to guess. If the letter is present, the program displays the locations of the
letter in the word. Otherwise, the program draws part of the hangman.
